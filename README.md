# Shelly Home

<b>Shelly Home</b> is a cross platform app created by the software developer <b>Dirk Gausmann</b>. It is developed in his free time and aims to bring a better user experience to <b>Shelly</b> users

<b>Shelly Home</b> is available on <b>Android, iOS, MacOS</b> and <b>Windows</b>. You can add, manage, update and control your <b>Shelly</b> devices aswell as highly customize how and what information you want to see.<br/>The app also does work without a user account and can directly access the <b>Shelly</b> devices located in the same network. Optionally the user can connect to its <b>Shelly Cloud</b> account, to be able to control the devices from anywhere.

In order to test devices and for Apple to validate my app I created a testsetup with multiple devices to test with. Included are <b>Shelly Pro 4pm</b>, <b>Shelly Plus 1</b>, <b>Shelly Plus 1pm</b>, <b>Shelly i3</b>, <b>Shelly RGBW2</b>, <b>Shelly Vintage</b> and <b>Shelly DUO RGBW GU10</b>

Default this testsystem is turned off by a Shelly Plug S but can be turned on if Apple wants to test it :) 

This setup also helps me integrating the new NG line into my app!
